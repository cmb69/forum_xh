<h1 id="forum_xh">Forum_XH</h1>
<p>Forum_XH facilitates the embedding of simple forums on a CMSimple_XH site. The user management relies on <a href="https://github.com/cmsimple-xh/memberpages">Memberpages</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/register_xh">Register_XH</a>.</p>
<p>Posting requires to be logged in as member, though the forums can be viewed publicly. This way no further provisions are necessary to avoid spam, and posting does not require any additional input such as user name, email address etc.</p>
<p>Forum_XH features a markup editor allowing basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode">BBCode</a> markup. All data are stored in flat files which are protected from concurrent access by pessimistic locking of the whole forum, so Forum_XH is not suitable for heavily frequented forums. Furthermore common advanced forum features such as user signatures, PMs, subscribing to topics etc. are not available.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Forum_XH is a plugin for CMSimple_XH. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0 with the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/fa_xh">Fa_XH plugin</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/plib_xh">Plib_XH plugin</a>. It requires PHP ≥ 7.0.0 with the JSON and Session extensions.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/forum_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/doku.php/installation">CMSimple_XH wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Backup the data on your server.</li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>forum/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions for the subdirectories <code>config/</code>, <code>css/</code>, and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Forum</code> in the back-end to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Forum</code>.</p>
<p>You can change the default settings of Forum_XH under <code>Config</code>. Hints for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your mouse.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Forum_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Inserting a forum on a page is done with the following plugin call:</p>
<pre><code>{{{forum(&#39;name-of-the-forum&#39;)}}}</code></pre>
<p>You can have as many forums as you like, but at most one per CMSimple_XH page. The forums are distinguished by their name, which may contain lowercase letters (<code>a</code>-<code>z</code>), digits (<code>0</code>-<code>9</code>) and hyphens (<code>-</code>) only.</p>
<p>After switching to view mode you will see the forum, and if it already contains topics, you can navigate through them. Posting new comments requires that you are logged in via <a href="https://github.com/cmsimple-xh/memberpages">Memberpages</a> or <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/register_xh">Register_XH</a>. Then you can also edit and delete your own posts. The CMSimple_XH administrator can edit and delete the posts from all users, but in order to post new comments, the administrator has to log in additionally as member. No additional admin functionality is provided in the back-end.</p>
<h3 id="bbcode">BBCode</h3>
<p>To allow users to markup their comments, basic BBCode is available. The following elements are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[b]bolded text[/b]</code>: <strong>bolded text</strong></li>
<li><code>[i]italicized text[/i]</code>: <em>italicized text</em></li>
<li><code>[u]underlined text[/u]</code>: <ins>underlined text</ins></li>
<li><code>[s]strikethrough text[/s]</code>: <del>strikethrough text</del></li>
<li><code>[url]https://cmsimple-xh.org/[/url]</code>: <a href="https://cmsimple-xh.org/" class="uri">https://cmsimple-xh.org/</a></li>
<li><code>[url=https://cmsimple-xh.org/]CMSimple\_XH[/url]</code>: <a href="https://cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a></li>
<li><code>[img]https://cmsimple-xh.org/userfiles/images/flags/en.gif[/img]</code>: <img src="https://cmsimple-xh.org/userfiles/images/flags/en.gif" /></li>
<li><code>[iframe]https://cmsimple-xh.org/userfiles/images/flags/en.gif[/iframe]</code>: <img src="https://cmsimple-xh.org/userfiles/images/flags/en.gif" /><br />
<em>Iframes are used to embed external content, for instance, Youtube videos.</em></li>
<li><code>[size=150]large text[/size]</code>: <span style="font-size:150%">large text</span></li>
<li><code>[list][*]One [*]Two[/list]</code>:
<ul>
<li>One</li>
<li>Two</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>[list=1][*]One [*]Two[/list]</code>:
<ol type="1">
<li>One</li>
<li>Two</li>
</ol></li>
<li><code>[quote]quoted text[/quote]</code>:
<blockquote>
quoted text
</blockquote></li>
<li><code>[code]monospaced text[/code]</code>: <code>monospaced text</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that nesting of the same kind of elements is not allowed (for instance, nested lists are not possible). The HTML created by the BBCode converter is always valid and secure (i.e. no script injection is possible). If any nesting of BBCode elements would result in invalid HTML, the offending elements will simply be ignored.</p>
<p>The usage of the markup editor should be pretty much self explaining. Please note that a simple preview is available via the rightmost button. If JavaScript is not available in the browser of the user, the editor is not available, but using BBCode in the textarea is still possible.</p>
